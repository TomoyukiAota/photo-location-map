import * as moment from 'moment';

// Note for using moment.js's duration:
// moment.js's duration does not always return good results regarding the diff of two moments,
// but it should be used instead of hand-crafted logic because of the following reasons:
// 1) Developing hand-crafted logic covering all edge cases seems very difficult.
//    It's due to the fact that a year can be 365 or 366 days and a month can be 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
//    The result could be totally nonsensical (e.g. NaN) if something goes wrong.
//    In fact, I tried developing hand-crafted logic but ended up having NaN for the cases I initially didn't come up with.
// 2) As of October 2022, the use cases are analytics where errors to some degree are acceptable
//    as long as nonsensical results such as NaN does not appear.
//    I'm not certain about the degree of the error of moment.js's duration,
//    but I believe it's better than hand-crafted logic because it's been used for a long time by many users.
//    It's not worth spending a lot of time on developing hand-crafted logic for the places where errors are accepted to some degree.
