## The file does not open after clicking the thumbnail or <img src="./resources/open-file-icon.svg" width=25> button

After clicking the thumbnail or <img src="./resources/open-file-icon.svg" width=16> button, the file is opened by the default app associated to the filename extension such as `.JPG` and `.HEIC`.

Double-clicking the file in Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS opens the file with the default app.

Therefore, please configure the default app associated to the filename extension so that the file can be opened by double-clicking the file in Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS.

After clicking

 (`IMG_0001.JPG` can be opened by clicking the thumbnail or <img src="./resources/open-file-icon.svg" width=16> button.)

After clicking
<img src="./resources/play-live-photos-icon.svg" width=16> button, the file is opened by the default app associated to `.MOV` or `.MP4` extension.

Double-clicking the file in Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS opens the file with the default app.

Therefore, please configure the default app associated to `.MOV` or `.MP4` extension so that the file can be opened by double-clicking the file in Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS.
