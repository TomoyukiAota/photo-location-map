    When "By Shooting Time" is selected, in order to sort files, this application
    <ol>
      <li>tries to use DateTimeOriginal in EXIF, and if it is not available,</li>
      <li>use the modified time of the file.</li>
    </ol>
    Note that folders are still sorted by their names since there is no concept of "Shooting Time" of folders.

    <p>Below are details for reference:</p>
    <p>DateTimeOriginal in EXIF is the most trustworthy information about the time when the photo is taken.</p>
    <p>DateTimeOriginal is written by the most cameras for the most JPEG/HEIF/TIFF files, but sometime it is missing.</p>
    <p>It is sure that the modified time always exists for files, and the modified time is likely the time when the photo is taken,
      so the modified time is used when DateTimeOriginal is not available.</p>
    <p>Also, files other than JPEG/HEIF/TIFF do not have EXIF in the first place, so the modified time is used for such files.</p>
