    When "By Shooting Time" is selected, in order to sort files, this application
    <ol>
      <li>tries to use DateTimeOriginal in EXIF, and if it is not available,</li>
      <li>use the modified time of the file.</li>
    </ol>
    Note that folders are sorted by their names since there is no concept of "Shooting Time" of folders.

    <p>DateTimeOriginal in EXIF is the most trustworthy information about the time when the photo was taken.</p>
    <p>DateTimeOriginal is written in most JPEG/HEIF/TIFF files by most cameras, but sometime it is missing.</p>
    <p>The modified time of the file is often the time when the photo was taken,
      so the modified time is used as an alternative when DateTimeOriginal is missing.</p>
    <p>Also, files other than JPEG/HEIF/TIFF do not have EXIF  in the first place, so the modified time is always used for such files.</p>
